My solution to the Word Wrap Kata problem in Ruby.

    Mistakes made while solving the kata:
    
        - Remember to push the ToDo and the examples in the same commit
        - Need to improve the 20 secs rule. If something is not easy when a test is in red, maybe is not the test to do at the moment
        - Remember when a refactor is in progress, to commit more often, not just when all is done
